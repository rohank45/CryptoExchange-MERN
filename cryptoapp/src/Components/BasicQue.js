            Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for
            goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies,
            often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the
            good or service that the company provides. Cryptocurrencies work
            using a technology called blockchain.

            The first method to convert any cryptocurrency into cash is through
            an exchange or a broker, this is quite similar to the currency

            Bitcoins to the exchange that supports buying and selling in INR.

            Due to their nature, cryptocurrencies are not regulated, which
            carries risk of market volatility and loss for investors. However,
