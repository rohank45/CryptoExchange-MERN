              Why trade in crypto?
            </h1>
            <p>
              In general, the cryptocurrency market is considered illiquid
              because the transactions are dispersed across multiple exchanges,
              which means that comparatively small trades can have huge impact
              on market prices. This means that your trades are more likely to
              be executed quickly and at a lower cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrencies are what stocks were centuries ago; they are the
              new-age asset class growing at a pace never seen before. Having
              successfully surpassed almost all trading instruments in terms of
              returns, they are on their way to becoming the go-to asset class,
              with around 11 million Indians trading in Cryptocurrencies. Start
              your trading journey now!
